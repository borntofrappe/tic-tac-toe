# tic-tac-toe

> A game of tic-tac-toe using SVG syntax and Svelte.

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/YzKLjmz)

## Preface

Ultimately, I plan to document this project with a series of posts.

In the different sub-folder you find the markup, stylesheet and script developing the game, one step at a time.

- SVG Loader. In this folder you find the loader developed for the application with SVG syntax. I have divided the effort in three folders to progressively build an animated loader in which the two signs **x** and **o** swap place,

- Svelte. In this folder you find the game developed with the **Svelte** framework.

## Todo

- [ ] write about the SVG loader.

- [ ] improve the application developed through Svelte.

- [ ] write about the Svelte framework.

- [ ] research how to implement AI, to play against a computer.
