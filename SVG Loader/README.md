# SVG Loader

The sub-folders describe the development of the loader in three steps:

1. **SVG syntax**. Drawing the shapes for the **x** and **o** signs.

1. **Utility groups**. Adding group elements for the animation.

1. **CSS animation**. Adding keyframe animations.

The final project has also a _goo_ shape, to fake a goo-y effect between the shapes.
