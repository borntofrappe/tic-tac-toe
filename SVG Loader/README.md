# SVG Loader

The loader is built in the following steps:

- **SVG syntax**. Drawing the basic shapes behind the component;

- **Utility groups**. Adding group elements for the animation.

- **CSS animation**. Adding keyframe animations.

The final project has also a _goo_ shape, to fake a goeey effect between the shapes.
